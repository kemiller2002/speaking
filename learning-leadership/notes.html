    <h2>Act I: The Shovel (≈7 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish credibility, humanity, and tension without explaining the thesis yet.</div>

    <p>I want to start with a short story.</p>

    <p>Years ago, one of my food companies operated in a small town where a single person owned a large percentage of the commercial buildings. Several restaurants, shops, warehouses. If something broke, eventually you ran into this person.</p>

    <p>One morning, an HVAC technician showed up early to fix an air conditioning unit before the restaurant opened. He was looking for the building owner.</p>

    <p>Instead, he found a guy in overalls sweeping the floor.</p>

    <p>They talked for a bit. The technician explained what he was there to fix. The guy in overalls walked him to the unit, showed him what was wrong, answered questions.</p>

    <p>Eventually the technician said, “I really need to talk to the owner before I start.”</p>

    <p>And the guy said, “I am the owner.”</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>That moment stuck with me.</p>

    <p>Because sometimes leadership looks like strategy, roadmaps, and prioritization.</p>

    <p>And sometimes leadership looks like sweeping the floor so the business can open on time.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>Most people in this room understand that instinctively. Software leaders especially. If a production issue is happening, you do not say “that’s not my job.” You jump in. You help. You pick up a shovel and start digging because the ditch is filling in and someone has to act.</p>

    <p>That instinct is not the problem.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>The problem is what happens after.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>Because picking up a shovel for a moment is very different from being handed one forever.</p>

    <p>And most organizational damage happens when no one notices the difference.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>I’m not here to talk about rigid roles, or job purity, or why people shouldn’t help. I believe in helping. I believe in learning. I believe in stepping outside your role when the situation demands it.</p>

    <p>What I want to talk about is what happens when learning quietly becomes ownership. When help quietly becomes expectation. And when leadership fails not loudly, but silently.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Act II: When Learning Becomes the Job (≈10 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Make the invisible pattern visible and recognizable.</div>

    <p>In most software organizations, this starts with good intentions.</p>

    <p>A product manager learns a little prototyping so they can communicate better with design.</p>

    <p>An engineer learns more about customer context so they can make better tradeoffs.</p>

    <p>A tech lead helps another team during a crunch because they understand the system.</p>

    <p>More recently, AI makes all of this easier. Drafting, analysis, documentation, prototyping. The friction to help is lower than it has ever been.</p>

    <p>None of this is bad.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>The failure mode is subtle.</p>

    <p>The work repeats.<br />
    Other people start depending on it.<br />
    There is no end date.<br />
    Nothing else slows down.</p>

    <p>At some point, learning quietly becomes the job.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>And the most dangerous part is this.</p>

    <p>No one decided it.</p>

    <p>There was no meeting. No handoff. No announcement that ownership had changed. It just happened because someone was capable and helpful and things were moving.</p>

    <p>From the outside, everything looks fine. Work is getting done. Deadlines are met. There is no obvious crisis.</p>

    <p>But something important has shifted.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>The organization has learned an unspoken rule. If something is unclear and important, someone will step in and carry it.</p>

    <p>That rule feels efficient.</p>

    <p>It is not.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>Because now ownership is no longer explicit. It flows toward the people who are most capable, most responsible, or least protected.</p>

    <p>And if nothing else pauses, the work is already real. The organization just hasn’t admitted it yet.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>This is where role clarity arguments usually show up. Someone says, “That’s not the PM’s job,” or “That’s not engineering’s responsibility,” or “That shouldn’t be happening.”</p>

    <p>They’re often right.</p>

    <p>But by the time the argument starts, the damage is already underway.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Act III: The Emotional Cost (≈8 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Make the cost human, not procedural.</div>

    <p>Here’s the part that took me the longest to see.</p>

    <p>The people who get quietly overloaded rarely complain.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>They don’t storm into meetings. They don’t escalate loudly. They don’t demand change.</p>

    <p>Instead, something else happens.</p>

    <p>They stop volunteering ideas.<br />
    They stop suggesting improvements.<br />
    They narrow their focus to exactly what is asked.</p>

    <p>From the outside, it looks like stability.</p>

    <p>From the inside, it’s withdrawal.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>And here’s what makes this particularly dangerous.</p>

    <p>The people most affected are usually the most capable ones.</p>

    <p>They were the ones who stepped in. They were the ones who learned the extra thing. They were the ones who picked up the shovel when the ditch needed digging.</p>

    <p>Not because they were told to.</p>

    <p>Because they cared.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>Over time, energy turns into caution.<br />
    Curiosity turns into compliance.<br />
    Ownership turns into obligation.</p>

    <p>By the time someone finally says something, they are often already halfway out the door.</p>

    <p>Leaders are surprised because nothing ever broke. Delivery never stopped. Metrics looked fine.</p>

    <p>But silence is not sustainability.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>This is why systems that rely on goodwill fail the people they most depend on.</p>

    <p>It is not that people stop caring. It is that caring without boundaries eventually costs too much.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>And this is the moment where most organizations think they have a people problem.</p>

    <p>They don’t.</p>

    <p>They have an ownership problem.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Transition to Act IV</h2>
    <p class="callout"><strong>Transition line:</strong> So if good intentions are not enough, why does this keep happening in smart teams with experienced leaders?</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Act IV: Why This Keeps Happening (Urgency, Heroics, and AI) (≈15 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Show this is structural, not a people problem. Explain why good teams still drift.</div>

    <p>I think this keeps happening for three reasons that show up in almost every software organization.</p>

    <p>The first is urgency.</p>

    <p>Urgency is where role clarity quietly dies. Not because people stop caring about boundaries, but because urgency makes every exception feel reasonable.</p>

    <p>We hear phrases like:<br />
      “We just need help this once.”<br />
      “It’s only for this release.”<br />
      “We’ll clean it up after.”</p>

    <p>Under pressure, the question shifts from “who owns this” to “who can do it fastest.” And the people who can help usually do. That’s not a character flaw. It’s responsibility.</p>

    <p>But here’s the problem.</p>

    <p>The urgency passes. The exception remains. No one circles back to reset ownership.</p>

    <p>What was temporary becomes expected. What was help becomes responsibility.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>The second is heroics.</p>

    <p>Most organizations say they want accountability, but what they reward is heroics. Someone stays late. Someone jumps in outside their role. Someone saves the deadline.</p>

    <p>That person gets praised. Sometimes they should.</p>

    <p>But the system does not change. Ownership does not move. Expectations quietly reset.</p>

    <p>The hero becomes the backstop.</p>

    <p>Over time, accountability erodes because the organization learns a rule: if something is important and unclear, someone will save it.</p>

    <p>Heroics solve today’s problem. Accountability prevents tomorrow’s.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>The third is AI.</p>

    <p>AI did not create role creep. It just made it faster.</p>

    <p>The moment a tool makes something easier, the question becomes “who can do this now,” not “who should own this.” Drafting, analysis, prototyping, documentation. The first step is cheap.</p>

    <p>And because the first step is cheap, the long-term cost becomes invisible.</p>

    <p>If AI output disappears tomorrow, who is accountable?</p>

    <p>If the answer is “the person who happened to generate it,” that is not ownership. That is role creep at machine speed.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p class="aside">Optional audience-check (keep it brief): “If you’ve seen any of these patterns, you’re not alone. This happens in strong orgs with good people.”</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Act V: The Leadership Moment People Avoid (≈8 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Name the real failure: choosing comfort over clarity when nothing is on fire yet.</div>

    <p>This brings us to the moment that decides whether this pattern becomes culture.</p>

    <p>Something important is getting done, but ownership is unclear.</p>

    <p>Someone capable steps in. The work moves forward. From the outside, it looks like leadership.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>The moment comes later, quietly.</p>

    <p>Do we name that this work now needs an owner?<br />
    Do we pause something else to make room for it?<br />
    Do we disappoint someone by saying this cannot continue informally?</p>

    <p>That is the moment most leaders skip. Not because they don’t see the problem, but because naming it creates friction.</p>

    <p>It means choosing clarity over comfort.<br />
    It means risking short-term momentum.<br />
    It means saying no to something that is working.</p>

    <p>So instead, we let it ride.</p>

    <p>The work continues. The dependency deepens. The person carrying it absorbs more weight.</p>

    <p>Nothing breaks immediately, which is why it is so dangerous.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>Leadership is not failing to act in a crisis. It is failing to act when nothing is obviously on fire yet.</p>

    <p>By the time the cost is visible, the decision has already been made through inaction.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Act VI: The Discipline That Holds (≈10 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="goal"><strong>Goal:</strong> Offer relief without turning the talk into a policy lecture. Give leaders usable guardrails.</div>

    <p>So what do you do with this, as a leader in software?</p>

    <p>I’m going to keep this simple, because complexity is how good intentions turn into process theater.</p>

    <p>First, learning needs an end date.</p>

    <p>Not “we’ll do it casually.” Not “sometime this quarter.” An end date. If learning goes long, you are no longer learning. You are staffing work without admitting it.</p>

    <p>Second, repetition is the signal. If the work repeats, learning is over. At that point, name ownership.</p>

    <p>Third, protect people from parallel learning overload.</p>

    <p>One active learning effort per person at a time. If someone wants to add another, something else has to pause. If nothing pauses, the learning does not proceed.</p>

    <p>Fourth, urgency creates exceptions. Exceptions require a reset. If you create an exception, assign someone to reset ownership when the urgency passes.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>Here’s the question that forces honesty.</p>

    <p><strong>What would we pause if this became real work?</strong></p>

    <p>If the honest answer is “nothing,” then the work is already real. You just haven’t admitted it yet.</p>

    <p>This is not about control. These are protection mechanisms. They protect the people who always say yes. They protect your best operators from becoming invisible infrastructure.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p>And I want to return to where we started.</p>

    <p>Picking up a shovel is leadership. Sometimes you do work that is not your job because it needs to be done.</p>

    <p>But picking up a shovel is not the same thing as being handed one forever.</p>

    <p>Most orgs don’t fail because people won’t help. They fail because leaders don’t decide when help ends.</p>

    <p><span class="pause">[pause]</span></p>

    <p class="aside">Close gently: “Still thinking about how often we confuse momentum with sustainability.”</p>
