# Talk Topics & Abstracts

Below are some of my most requested talks. Each can be adapted to your audience, length, and event format.

## The Diagnostic Mindset: How to See What Others Miss

**Audience Level:** Intermediate → Executive  
**Ideal Length:** 45-minute talk or 60-minute keynote  
**Tags:** diagnostics, systems-thinking, leadership, architecture, complexity, devops, organizational-design  

**Abstract**  
Most organizations treat problems as isolated events. Diagnostic thinkers treat them as symptoms of deeper system behavior. In this talk, we explore how to build a mental architecture that cuts through noise, identifies structural causes, and reveals hidden incentives driving outcomes. Drawing from engineering, medicine, construction forensics, and organizational psychology, I present a practical framework for understanding why systems behave the way they do—and how to reshape them toward stability. This session is designed for engineers, architects, product leaders, and executives who want to solve harder problems with more clarity, fewer assumptions, and a more coherent model of reality.

**Key Takeaways**

- How diagnostic thinkers identify patterns in chaos  
- Why most failures “cluster” around invisible constraints  
- A field-tested method for quickly modeling unfamiliar systems  
- How incentives—not intentions—predict system behavior  
- How to shift from treating symptoms to uncovering hidden structures

## Postmortems Are Autopsies: How to Actually Learn From Failure

**Audience Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**Ideal Length:** 45-minute SRE/engineering talk  
**Tags:** postmortems, sre, devops, incident-response, reliability, systems-thinking, human-factors  

**Abstract**  
Most postmortems are performance art—socially safe narratives that protect feelings but hide truth. This talk reframes them using principles from medicine, aviation, systems engineering, and real-world forensic investigations. Attendees learn how to turn postmortems into genuine diagnostic tools that reveal patterns, uncover misaligned incentives, and drive meaningful improvements. I walk through step-by-step techniques for reconstructing incidents, separating systems failure from human blame, and generating insights that persist longer than the meeting notes. If you’ve ever run a postmortem that produced no lasting change—or if you lead teams where the same incidents keep repeating—this talk will change the way you view failure.

**Key Takeaways**

- Why most postmortems fail (and how to fix them)  
- How to avoid hindsight bias and narrative distortion  
- The structure of a “non-theatrical” postmortem  
- Diagnostic interviewing techniques that reveal truth  
- How to use incidents to improve culture, not punish people

## Why Systems Fail at 2 A.M.: The Hidden Incentives Behind Outages

**Audience Level:** Intermediate  
**Ideal Length:** 40–45 minutes  
**Tags:** outages, sre, devops, org-psychology, incentives, complexity, reliability  

**Abstract**  
Outages rarely originate from a single bad decision or failing component. Most of the time, they’re the inevitable result of hidden incentives, process shortcuts, organizational blind spots, and mismatches between design and reality. In this talk, I reveal the structural forces that make systems brittle—and why they almost always break under the worst possible conditions. Using examples from engineering, product, and organizational failures, I show how to read “incentive fingerprints,” identify misalignment long before it causes an incident, and redesign processes so that the right outcome becomes the default outcome.

**Key Takeaways**

- Why incidents cluster at predictable times  
- How organizational incentives quietly shape technical outcomes  
- Early-warning signals of systems drifting toward failure  
- The psychology of nighttime outages  
- How to build teams and systems that fail gracefully

## Architecture as a System of Constraints: Why Structure Beats Talent

**Audience Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**Ideal Length:** 45–60 minutes  
**Tags:** architecture, platform-engineering, complexity, cognitive-load, design, reliability  

**Abstract**  
Most architecture discussions focus on tools, diagrams, and patterns. World-class architecture is defined by something far more fundamental: constraints. Constraints shape behavior, eliminate entire categories of failures, and create environments where even average developers produce excellent outcomes. Drawing from manufacturing, cooking, design theory, and platform engineering, I demonstrate how constraint-driven architecture leads to more resilient, scalable, and predictable systems. Attendees learn how to design systems that protect themselves, guide developers toward good decisions, and reduce cognitive load across teams.

**Key Takeaways**

- Why constraints are the most powerful architectural tool  
- How to create “self-guiding” systems that reduce errors  
- Tradeoffs: when to constrain vs. when to allow flexibility  
- The relationship between constraints and team performance  
- How constraints reduce complexity and cognitive load

## Complexity Without Arrogance: A Framework for Thinking Clearly When Everything Is On Fire

**Audience Level:** Executive / Staff+ Engineering  
**Ideal Length:** 45–60 minute keynote  
**Tags:** complexity, leadership, decision-making, systems-thinking, staff-engineering, org-design  

**Abstract**  
Complexity often becomes a performance art—a way for smart people to signal intelligence without offering clarity. Real complexity requires humility, grounding, and the ability to separate signal from noise under pressure. In this talk, I present a practical framework for navigating high-stakes, high-uncertainty situations without becoming overwhelmed or overconfident. Combining systems thinking, cognitive science, engineering forensics, and leadership psychology, I lay out an approach that helps teams reason clearly even when information is incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory.

**Key Takeaways**

- How to stay grounded in high-uncertainty situations  
- Distinguishing performative complexity from real complexity  
- Frameworks for making decisions under pressure  
- How clarity emerges from constraints  
- Techniques for de-escalating chaos while staying factual
